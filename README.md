# AIRBOOKER

Airbooker allows a user to find and sign up for flights for up to 4 passengers, and then sends an email confirmation upon successful booking.

Airbooker utilizes nested forms, drop down menus, multiple models (Airports, Flights, Passengers, Bookings), and mailers in order to represent and deliver its data to the user.
